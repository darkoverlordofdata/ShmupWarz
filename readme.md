# shmupwarz-objc


Hmm, I've never even known anyone who owns an Apple product, so ObjectiveC? Well, I do prefer c to c++.

Features:

* ObjFW objective-c framework
* a custom gl loader using sdl - no glew/glu/glut or anything else, just gl.h
* tglm (tiny glm) - clang native vector matrix math
* compiled using c18 std with clang 10
